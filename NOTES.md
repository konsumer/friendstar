# IDEAS

- lots of friends
- every village has a church (for the god)
- "secret" God friends (don't show in START) that you get when you befriend all people in a village

# GODS

- fire - desert
- water - snowy
- earth - forest
- wind - holy

- Each god will give you differnt conversations in churches.
- If you get a god for a village all doors are open

# ENDGAME

Must have all the gods (every friend in game) and they will battle some big enemy for you.


# FRIENDS

## David

- Lives in Forest Village.
- No quest, just talk to them.


## Sandra

## Simon

## Bella

## Oreo

## Inky

- Lives in Forest Village.
- Get lost synth (well)
- Friend them to get a new village music track?
- 1 friend to open door.
- BUG: get synth first, then meet, it deletes
- BUG: synth should show in house after you talk to Inky (as an indicator you completed quest)


## Alijah

## Riley

## Angel

- Missing kid
- 3 friends to open door
- kid should be in house to indicate quest is completed
- BUG: her door doesn't open at same time as James (it should)

## Danny

- Lives in Forest Village.
- 5 friends to friend her.
- Computer should show as indicator that you are friends, use it to save


## Mason

## Bobby

## Charlie

## James

- Wants a turnip for dinner.
- Must fight turnip in hole, in forest
- better fighting would maybe be better (inventory, stats, etc) but I also like the simple "anyone can fight, just don't give up" approach
- 2 friends to open door
- BUG: if you kill turnip first, he doesn't get it
- BUG: turnip should show in house after you talk to Inky (as an indicator you completed quest)

## Mike

## Tim

## Emily

## Kristin

## Josh

## Sara

## Wade

## Liz

## Steve

## Laura

## Nicole

## Anne

## Donna



# WALKTHROUGH

- start in forest
- friend David ion Forest Village
- get Inky's synth, talk to them to friend
- talk to James, fight turnip, talk to James
- talk to Angel, talk to batman-kid in forest ("I am the night!"), convince him to go with you ("there is a crime happening in village...") talk to Angel
