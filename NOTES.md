# IDEAS

- lots of friends
- every village has a church (for the god)
- "secret" God friends (don't show in START) that you get when you befriend all people in a village

# ISSUES

- fix initial menu to allow continue/new
- saves on each scene-change?
- fix forest flag (shows message after initial, sometimes)
- add more flags: met/quest/inventory to split the gates between multiple flags
- better "village music", make it go with the gods
- fix village church color/tiles, maybe outside of village?
- check all dialogs fior fitting
- better fighting, it's just a demo now, add smack-talk and maybe weapons & run?


# GODS

- fire - desert
- water - snowy
- earth - forest
- wind - holy

# ENDGAME

Must have all the gods (every friend in game) and they will battle some big enemy for you.
