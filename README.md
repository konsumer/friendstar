Gameboy Color/DMG game about social-networking for [Retro Platform Jam #7](https://itch.io/jam/retro-platform-jam-7).

## assets

All the asset-source is [here](assets/src). I use [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to make sprites & maps, and [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/) for everything else.
