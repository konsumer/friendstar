# IDEAS

- lots of friends
- every village has a church (for the god)
- "secret" God friends (don't show in START) that you get when you befriend all people in a village

# FRIENDS

## Forest

### David

- No quest, just talk to them.

### Inky

- Get lost synth (well)
- Friend them to get a new village music track?
- 1 friend to open door.

### Angel

- Missing kid
- 3 friends to open door
- kid should be in house to indicate quest is completed

### James

- Wants a turnip for dinner.
- Must fight turnip in hole, in forest
- better fighting would maybe be better (inventory, stats, etc) but I also like the simple "anyone can fight, just don't give up" approach
- 2 friends to open door

### Danny

- 5 friends to friend her.
- Computer should show as indicator that you are friends, use it to save


## Desert

### Belle

- Must beat Horse in a rap-battle

### Josh

- Get the bike part
- 6 friends to open door

# WALKTHROUGH
